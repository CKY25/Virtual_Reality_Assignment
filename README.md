# VR Cross Road
This is my BACS3063 Virtual Reality Assignment. This is a educational VR application that teaches mainly children on how to cross the road safely. Since this course is during the short semester which only has 7 weeks and we only have less than 1 month time to develop, therefore this project does not have any complex mechanics due to time constraint. This game consists of 3 levels, with the first level teaching the players to always look left and right before crossing the road to ensure safety. The second level teaches the player to utilize the traffic light by pressing the button to change the traffic light from red to green in order to cross the road safely. The last level will need the players to combine everything learnt from the previous levels and use them to cross the road safely. That basically is the whole game and it is a simple educational game. </br>
